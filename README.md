# Playing with Typer
This is just a simple play repo for learning a bit about [typer](https://pypi.org/project/typer/)

See [example index](INDEX.md) for an overview of what each example illustrates

For reference, here is the [typer documentation](https://pypi.org/project/typer/)

# Since I'm also playing with `uv`
Here are the additional commands I ran:
- `uv pip compile -v -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml` to create requirements file
- `uv pip sync requirements.txt` to install requirements
- `uv pip freeze` to show installed packages
